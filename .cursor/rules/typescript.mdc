# TypeScript

- Keep functions small and single-purpose.
- Reuse existing utilities before adding new ones.
- Avoid `any`; prefer `unknown` + narrowing or Zod validation.
- Prefer union types over enums for simple sets.
- Use `readonly` for immutable arrays/objects.
- Keep changes focused; avoid unrelated refactors.
