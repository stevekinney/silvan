# Bun

- Use Bun for all installs and scripts (`bun install`, `bun add`, `bun run <script>`).
- Keep `bun.lock` as the only lockfile; do not add npm/yarn/pnpm locks.
- Prefer Bun built-ins (Bun.serve, Bun.file, Bun.env, Bun.fetch) when they fit.
- Use `bun run` for repo scripts; keep `package.json` scripts as the source of truth.

## Common scripts

- `bun run dev`
- `bun run build`
- `bun run lint` / `bun run lint:fix`
- `bun run typecheck`
- `bun run test` / `bun run test:coverage`
- `bun run format` / `bun run format:check`
- `bun run validate`
