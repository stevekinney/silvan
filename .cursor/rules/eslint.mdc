# ESLint

- Keep files lint clean; prefer fixes over disables.
- Use `import type` for type-only imports.
- Use the `node:` prefix for Node built-ins.
- Remove unused imports/vars; prefix `_` only when required by an API.
- Keep imports sorted (let ESLint and simple-import-sort enforce it).
- If you must disable a rule, scope it to one line and add a short reason.
